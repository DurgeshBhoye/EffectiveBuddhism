                    truths, However
                    I believe Buddhists have lost the way of Buddha and lack a real basis of impact. Effective Buddhism
                    is a solution to those who seek to follow the Buddhists path as Buddha wanted. If Buddha was alive
                    today, Image in the amount of change and impact he would be having.</p>

                <div class="col-md-6">
                    <p><strong>If you go searching</strong>, there are many other ways these four vows are written, but
                        they are all
                        telling the same thing, in this order. </p>
                    <p>As anyone may observe from the outside, the most influential people in the world today are not
                        Buddhists. On top of that anyone from a Non-Buddhist city, will tell you that they have not
                        heard from a Buddhist about why that path is best. </p>
                    <p>It is a sickness is the Buddha communities today to ignore the first vow, and try to move on to
                        2,3, and 4. By the very means of the vows, step 2 cannot be done without first completing step
                        1. Step 1 is in fact, an earthly desire. The Four Main Vows are a harmonious right of passage
                        that must be balanced in action towards their completion.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="col-md-6">
                    <p>Therefore, the way of the Buddha should be to renounce all worldly desires IN ORDER TO save all
                        people, and to learn all teachings IN ORDER TO save all people, and that once these steps are
                        completed perfect enlightenment will be attained. This means that these tasks are in harmony. As
                        one renounces more wordy desires to spend more time saving people, one learns teachings to
                        improve how they go about saving others, and rides the collective path towards enlightenment.
                    </p>
                    <p>However, instead of following this path and order, Buddhists today are known as people
                        continually meditating. Struggling to awaken and renounce all worldly desires, and instead all
                        acting to each other like they are farther along the path. I believe Buddhism has become a sick
                        game of ineffective spiritual ego stroking.</p>

                                their path of enlightenment, instead that it is very sad that so much potential is
                                moving towards the wrong place for the world to awaken and be saved. It is a fact these
                                people who realize their potential to follow the first vow will be some of the strongest

                            <p>The funny thing about tech entrepreneurs who are rapidly changing the future, and
                                Buddhism is that these tech entrepreneurs are slowly learning the way of the Buddha in
                                order to optimize themselves. They are reaching new paths of enlightenment. Instead of
                                referring to their actions as the Buddha way, they are learning the teachings of Buddha
                                in order to be more effective. </p>

                way of Buddha himself. Buddha was an enlightened being who spread his philosophy far and wide, preaching

                    <p>“In Buddhism, enlightenment (called bodhi in Indian Buddhism, or satori in Zen Buddhism) is when
                        a Buddhist finds the truth about life and stops being reborn because they have reached Nirvana.”
                        In order to stop the cycle of rebirth, we must stop the death to life cycle. With infinite time
                        our particles are always brought back to a conscious form. Until we find a conscious form to
                        reach Nirvana in, we will repeat the cycle.</p>
